USB Wall -- kernel-based security module for USB mass-storage device filtering 

----------- Description -----------
USB Wall, is a kind of firewall for USB storage device like pen drive and external hard drive. 
It concerns Linux PC and is developed for network administrators.

     registration of the pen drive, actions between the storage device and PC,…
