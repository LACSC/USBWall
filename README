The USBWall project
-------------------

The goal of the usbwall project is to add a complete USB mass-storage filtering system in the Linux
kernel.
Through filtering we would like to support:

1) USB Storage white-listing, permitting to allow only specific pre-registered usb devices. Other
devices are simply unaccessible from any userspace tools such as mount.
2) USB Storage fine grain filtering, specifying which action can be done for each allowed device,
such as read, write, execute, setu(g)id root execution, etc. This function needs to be integrated
in a complete security suite which is not supported by now.
3) Simple listing management through graphical user interface.
4) High level API definition through a userspace library, allowing to update or modify the module
interface without impacting userspace software. Only the abstraction library has to be updated.

The USBWall module
------------------
This is the source repository of the USBWall module.
This sources contain only the Linux kernel module. The library and the currently being implemented
applications can be found on github:
https://github.com/LACSC/

The module currently support whitelisting through usb mass storage devices injection. By now, there
is no automatic key injection at startup. This should be done by the user using the startup scripts
of his distribution

Limitations
-----------
In order to be functionnal, the usb_storage module has to be compiled as a module (not statically)
this is the case in all major distributions for desktop), and the usbwall module has to be loaded
_before_ usb_storage. In the other case, the usb_storage module will take the hand on the device
first and the filtering will not be supported.

This limitation will be corrected in the future.
